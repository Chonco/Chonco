# About me

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi!, Iâ€™m Bruno HernÃ¡ndez but you can call me @Chonco, it's my videogames nickname haha
- I'm a Software Development student at CETI Colomos University (Guadalajara, Mexico)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Java, I have been practicing since 2019 but i felt that i needed to improve my skills so I started a course, Hyperskills Java Course.

And I do not know what else, I hope my perfil grow up as well as my carreer as Software Engineer.

Good day to all of you.
