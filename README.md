# About me

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi!, Iâ€™m Bruno HernÃ¡ndez but you can call me @Chonco, it's my videogames nickname haha
- I'm a Software Development student at CETI Colomos University (Guadalajara, Mexico)
- Iâ€™m also a Full Stack developer at Oracle, been there since february 2022.
- Currently I'm learning Rust, saw a video of it and I liked the syntaxis a lot, so, here I am.

And I do not know what else, I hope my perfil grow up as well as my carreer as Software Engineer.

Good day to all of you.
